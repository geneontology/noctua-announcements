This is for Noctua related announcements and 'announcement banner' for the Noctua landing page, Noctua Form Editor and Visual Pathway Editor used to announce, planned outages, updates, new feature documentation, getting started links, etc. This would likely be an effective way of reaching active Noctua users.

### Adding/Removing Announcements

Edit the notification.json file and either PR or if you are an admin, you can edit on the fly. Check the example file for format. Please use the format as described above. After updating to GitHub, wait like few seconds or so then the new notifications will be ready.

**Note**

For now Noctua has to manually be refreshed to have new notifications. This is only for prototype
